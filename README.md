#### Summary
The present disclosure relates to a transaction method using electronic money and, more particularly, to a system and method for electronic money transaction, capable of preventing an error which may occur during a process of generating a block chain and strengthening security regarding transactional information of electronic money, while allowing electronic money users to directly exchange real money.  According to the system and method for an electronic money transaction according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, since electronic money users may directly exchange electronic money with real money through an exchange server, an electronic money transaction procedure may be simplified.  In addition, since an address of a point-of-sale (POS) terminal is used as a virtual address, security of transaction details may be enhanced. In addition, by introducing a game-type electronic money mining process, interest of a user in the use of electronic money may be increased.  Also, since electronic money information is changed on the basis of transaction data confirmed in validity, an error that may occur in a process of generating a block chain may be prevented and security of transaction details of electronic money may be strengthened.
